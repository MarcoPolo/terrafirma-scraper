# Terra Firma Scraper

This a web scraper that utilises Servo â€” a high performance browser engine from Mozilla. You pass in a public URL and a CSS selector through its query parameters, and it returns scraped data.

Forked from https://rust-scraper.now.sh/ but compiled to Wasm to run in TerraFirma.
